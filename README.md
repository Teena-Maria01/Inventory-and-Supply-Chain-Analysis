Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing inventory and supply chain performance using Power BI. The objective was to create an interactive dashboard that provides clear visibility into inventory levels, warehouse utilization, transportation costs, lead times, and order fulfillment performance.

The dashboard helps identify inefficiencies and supports data-driven decision-making in supply chain operations.

Business Objective

Excess inventory and high storage costs

Stockouts and backorders

High transportation expenses

Long supplier lead times

Poor warehouse capacity utilization

The goal of this project was to organize and analyze operational data to uncover insights that improve efficiency and reduce costs.

Tools & Technologies Used

Power BI

Power Query (Data cleaning & transformation)

DAX (KPI calculations)

Microsoft Excel (Data source)

Data Preparation & Modeling

Cleaned and transformed raw data using Power Query

Standardized date formats and removed inconsistencies

Handled missing values and duplicates

Structured the data model for accurate reporting

Created calculated measures using DAX for KPI analysis

Key KPIs & Metrics Developed

Inventory Turnover Ratio (23.47) – Measures how efficiently inventory is sold

Days Sales in Inventory (16 days) – Indicates how long inventory stays before being sold

Warehouse Utilization (82.78%) – Measures warehouse capacity efficiency

Transportation Cost by Region & Category – Identifies high-cost areas

Average Lead Time by Category – Evaluates supply chain responsiveness

Backorders by Order Status – Tracks fulfillment issues

Units Sold by Year – Identifies sales trends

Inventory Levels by Category & Region – Detects overstocking or shortages

Key Insights Identified

Some product categories have higher lead times, increasing risk of stockouts

Certain regions show higher transportation costs

Backorders highlight gaps between demand and supply

Warehouse utilization indicates potential optimization opportunities

Sales trends help support better inventory planning
